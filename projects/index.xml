      <description>A mechanism that automates the depositing of waste containers.
Summary Link to heading My team and I created a mechanism that could life a hopper to empty dispose of containers as part of a recycling system. The design is driven by a rotational actuator. With aid of the first link, the torque of the actuator will be transferred to the connecting link. The function of connecting link is to convert rotary motion into oscillating motion to push the final link.</description>

      <description>A Python program to control the movement of a robotic arm and its gripper to sort 6 autoclave locations.
Check My Project On Github
Summary Link to heading I developed a Python program that autonomously spawns and sorts autoclaves into the appropriate location based on specific attributes. The real-life application of this program would be for using these containers to store the surgical tools and sterilize them in the autoclave.</description>
