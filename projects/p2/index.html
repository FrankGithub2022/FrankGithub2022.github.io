In many remote regions around the world, there are many places that don’t have access to good healthcare. One aspect of good healthcare is having a good system for sanitizing medical tools. We wanted to come up with a solution, so that they can also have a good way to clean medical instruments. The solution was to use a robotic arm which can be accessed remotely to perform the task of sterilization. A container was also designed within a given footprint to hold the medical equipment to allow them to be securely transferred to the autoclave.</p>
<p><img src="/img/P2_2.jpg" alt="P2_2.jpg">
After inserting the tool into its container and putting the container on the starting position, the Q-Arm will first identify the size and color of the container. This information will be fed to our function, which takes an ID and makes decisions on where the container must be placed after being picked up. We built a function in Python to return the target locations for each container. Next, we built several functions to control the Gripper, End-Effector and Autoclave drawer. Inside each function, we made a loop so that each step must be done in order. To go to the next step, the Q-arm will only execute if the correct arm positions were made. This was done by having inputs of left EMG and right EMG sensors. To ensure the task terminated upon completion, we used a break statement inside each loop to terminate the function. To spawn all containers without repeats, we built a list that will randomly generate 6 unique integers from 1 to 6 (corresponding to 6 containers). Then we set a counter initially at 0. While the counter is not equal to 6, for each time an item from the list is spawned, the counter will add 1. If the counter reaches 6, the spawning will stop. After all containers are placed, the Q-arm returns to its resting position.</p>
