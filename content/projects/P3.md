The design is driven by a rotational actuator. With aid of the first link, the torque of the actuator will be transferred to the connecting link. The function of connecting link is to convert rotary motion into oscillating motion to push the final link. The force will drive the final link to lift the hopper vertically and drop the recyclable materials.
